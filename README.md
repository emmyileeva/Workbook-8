## ðŸš“ SQLDatabaseExampleGTA (Bay City SQL: Mini-Challenges)

A set of 6 interactive console challenges using **JDBC** and **SQL Server** to query and manipulate data from a fictional Grand Theft Auto-style database. All challenges are accessible through a simple menu.

### ðŸ§© Challenges Implemented

1. **The Informant**

   - JOIN between Citizens and Vehicles.

3. **Citizen's Vehicle Fleet**
   - List all vehicles owned by a given citizen.
   - Shows type, brand, and whether each vehicle is stolen.

4. **Average Mission Payout**
   - Displays the average payout for all missions.
   - Uses SQL aggregate function `AVG()`.

5. **Agents Without Missions**
   - Lists citizens who have not completed any missions.
   - Uses `LEFT JOIN` with a `NULL` check.

6. **Top 3 Criminals (Stolen Vehicle Missions)**
